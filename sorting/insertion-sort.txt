General Idea: builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger portion which is always sorted
insert each element one at a time into the sorted portion/half of the array
Taking an element and inserting it one at a time in the correct order

Example:
function insertionSort(arr) {
  // start at the second element in the array to compare to the first
  for(let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++){
    let currentVal = arr[i];
    // loop through each element backwards comparing each element
    for(let j = i - 1; j >= 0 && arr[j] > currentVal; j--){
      // correctly place it at the right sorted index
      arr[j+1] = arr[j]
    }
    // set the currentVal to where it is sorted last
    arr[j+1] = currentVal;
  }
  return arr;
}
