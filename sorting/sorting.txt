For sorting it is very important in programming.

The following algorithms are quite similar when compared in the grand scheme of things.
- Insertion sort, selection sort, and bubble sort are all quite simple and have a quadratic(On^2) time complexity;
although insertion and bubble sort are linear time complexities when the data is almost sorted. Selection is always slow.
- These three algorithms are actually better when there is a small data set.
