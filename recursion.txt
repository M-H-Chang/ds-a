A process (function) that calls itself.

Why it's important:
- It's everywhere

Call stack: a data structure that tells us when each function should be called.
- Any time a function is invoked it is pushed on the top of the call stack
- When JS sees the return keyword or when the function ends, the compiler will remove it from the call stack

Two Essential parts:
- Base case: when the recursion stops
- Different output: changing the output so you pass it through the function again
